Correcting Methylation Calls in Low-Mappability Regions

\begin_layout Abstract
DNA methylation is an important component in vital biological functions
 such as embryonic development, carcinogenesis, and heritable regulation.
 Accurate methods to assess genomic methylation status are crucial to its
 effective use in many scenarios, especially in the detection and diagnosis
 of disease.
 Methylation aligners, such as Bismark and bwa-meth, frequently assign MapQ
 values to reads which are significantly higher than can be supported by
 the uniqueness of the region they are mapped to.
 These incorrectly high MapQs result in inappropriate methylation calling
 in repetitive regions.
 We observe reads that should map to separate locations (possibly having
 different methylation states) actually end up mapping to the same locus,
 causing apparent mixed methylation at such loci.
 Methylation calling can be improved by using Bismap mappability data to
 filter out insufficiently unique reads.
 Simply filtering out Cs in insufficiently unique regions is not adequate
 as it is prone to overfiltering Cs in small mappability dips.
 These Cs can in fact often be called using reads anchored in a nearby mappable
 region.
 We have created a patch for the MethylDackel methylation caller to perform
 read-based filtering.
 Read-based filtering resolves some of the apparent mixed methylation to
 either 0% or 100% methylation
\change_inserted -1421919639 1628616953
 and removes many unsupportable methylation calls
\change_unchanged
.
 We examined methylation calls with and without read-based filtering in
 or near the 7830 genes containing ClinVar variants in a methylation sequencing
 data set from the NA12878 cell line and in tumor samples.
 Examining low mappability Cs in the NA12878 data set revealed 1405 mixed
 methylation Cs were corrected to 0% methylation, and 2577 mixed methylation
 Cs were corrected to 100% methylation.

\begin_layout Standard
As DNA methylation status can have a significant biological function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, it is important that there be an accurate way of calling methylation on
 a genome.
 Although there are multiple varieties of DNA methylation, a significant
 type is methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "breiling_epigenetic_2015"

.
 Data on DNA cytosine methylation state can be gathered using a methylation
 sequencing technique (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), for example bisulfite sequencing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In bisulfite sequencing, unmethylated cytosines are deaminated to uracil
 by the addition of sodium bisulfite.
 5-methylcytosines are not affected.
 Since uracil sequences as thymine and 5-methylcytosine sequences as cytosine,
 positions of unmethylated Cs in a reference sequence can be identified
 by C->T transitions

It is also possible to use an enzymatic method, EM-seq, employing TET2 to
 oxidize 5-methylcytosine and an APOBEC enzyme to deaminate unmodified cytosines
 to uracil.
 While sodium bisulfite treatment produces other DNA damage, this enzymatic
 method deaminates with more precision

\begin_layout Standard
A read must be unambiguously placed if it is to provide information about
 a specific locus.
 Reads that equally match more than one area of the reference genome should
 not be used to assess methylation of any given C.
 To avoid calling Cs using reads derived from multiple genomic loci, methylation
 aligners (and read aligners in general) assign a MapQ value to each read
 alignment (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:seq"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 According to the SAM specification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "the_sam/bam_format_specification_working_group_sequence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, MapQ is defined as: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $-10\log_{10}\Pr\{\mathrm{mapping\ position\ is\ wrong}\}$
\end_inset

, rounded to the nearest integer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 MapQ indicates how uniquely placed a read alignment is, that is, in how
 many other places could the read align to the reference.
 A low MapQ means that the read may align in many places throughout the
 genome (for instance, a read of centromeric satellite DNA would likely
 have a very low MapQ).
 A high MapQ indicates that the read likely aligns where it is placed and
 nowhere else in the genome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A methylation caller can use accurate MapQ values to filter out reads with
 multiple placements in the genome, allowing the resulting methylation calls
 to accurately reflect their specific loci.

\begin_layout Standard
While evaluating the methylation aligner bwa-meth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2014arXiv1401.1129P"

\end_inset

, we observed a significant number of reads with unexpectedly high MapQ
 values in repetitive regions (e.g.
 centromeres).
 After observing these high MapQ reads in the centromere and larger repetitive
 regions, we investigated to see if smaller regions might also be too repetitive
 to support the high aligner MapQ estimates observed.
 We identified repetitive regions using data from Bismap 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "karimzadeh2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, a tool that counts the number of occurrences of every single K-mer of
 a particular length (in this case, k=100) in the genome to create a mappability
 score (ranging from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.01) for every base in the
 GRCh38 reference.
 <bases this on assumption that each locus is either 0 or 100%
\change_inserted -1421919639 1627325677
 <what does this note mean exactly? I forgot.>
\change_unchanged
> Bismap takes the effect of C->T conversion into account and therefore
 produces data which is applicable in the context of methylation sequencing.
 Reads entirely contained within a region of low mappability should not
 have high MapQ values due to their repetitiveness, however we observed
 many high-MapQ reads in regions with very low or zero Bismap mappability
 (see Figure

While low MapQ can indicate repetitiveness, even stringent MapQ thresholds
 cannot reliably select reads for safe methylation calling in regions containing
 repetitive DNA.
 We considered excluding methylation calls on Cs found in low-mappability
 regions (e.g.
 using bedtools), but rejected this approach because it is prone to both
 over- and underfiltering.
 Cs in short, unique regions would be kept (underfiltered) even if the surroundi
ng DNA is repetitive (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:discarded"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, this situation was not commonly observed.
 Overfiltering of Cs in short repetitive regions is a larger problem though.
 In this scenario, a C located in a small dip in mappability would be eliminated
 (overfiltered) despite coverage from read pairs anchored in nearby unique
 regions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:kept"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In practice, underfiltering is rare (

\change_inserted -1421919639 1628689108
 Although even about 1% of called Cs might seem small, the total number
 of called Cs without filtering is large enough that that 1.054% is on the
 order of 12.1 million Cs, while 
\begin_inset Formula $7.756*10^{-5}\%$
\end_inset

 of Cs is closer to 900 Cs.

\change_unchanged
 In cases where reads from multiple low-mappability regions are placed onto
 one region (creating a coverage spike), filtering by coverage could possibly
 also remove the problematic region, but in cases where reads are simply
 mixed among multiple low-mappability regions (not creating a coverage spike),
 coverage filtering would not be effective at removing the affected regions.

\change_inserted -1421919639 1628688752
 In addition, if some of the reads used to call a C are uniquely mappable,
 but others are not, per-read filtering can remove only those reads that
 are not uniquely mappable, rather than being forced to discard the entire
 locus like per-C filtering does.

We compared the effect of per-read mappability filtering on number of C's
 called, as well as number of C's called in low-mappability regions (as
 defined by per-C filtering), on EM-seq samples of 3 sample masses aligned
 with the bwa-meth aligner.
 We saw a significant positive filtering effect on all 3 sample masses,
 with a mean of 7.67 million Cs filtered out by read-based filtering in each
 sample (see Figure

We also examined how many mixed methylation (0% < %Methyl < 100%) Cs were
 resolved to either 0% or 100% methylation, and found that approximately
 60,000-90,000 methylation calls in the EM-seq data that were previously
 mixed were resolved by per-read filtering to either fully unmethylated
 or fully methylated (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), showing how unlike per-C filtering, per-read filtering can clean up methylati
on calls without always having to entirely delete them.

Effect on Potentially Significant Genes

We also assessed the biological significance of these miscalls.
 To measure this, we used genes in GENCODE containing variants in ClinVar
 (henceforth 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ClinVar genes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) as a metric for biological significance.
 To focus on genes that may contain miscalls, we filtered the list to only
 include those genes which had at least one region, either in the gene or
 in the 2kb upstream of the gene (in order to capture regulatory regions),
 where the mappability is too low to call methylation (as without this,
 there will be no miscalls in the region).
 Examination of this data in IGV
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "robinson_integrative_2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 revealed that there were miscalls in or upstream of 1447-1586 unique genes
 in the EM-seq/bwa-meth data, with a median number of 64 miscalls per gene
 region, indicating that indeed this may affect biologically significant
 methylation data.
 It is evident that the sites of most methylation miscalls fall into two
 broad types.
 First, there are those regions that simply have a mappability of 0 for
 a long stretch of sequence, resulting in all Cs that were called in this
 region being miscalls (as there are no mappable regions to anchor reads
 in).
 Second, there are those regions at the border between high mappability
 and low mappability.
 These regions are where overfiltered (and underfiltered) Cs (by per-C filtering
, as opposed to our per-read filtering) are found: overfiltered Cs occur
 when a C is in the low mappability region, but there is a mappable read
 anchored in the high mappability region that allows it to be called.
 Underfiltered C's occur when a C is just inside a mappable region, but
 there is no sufficiently mappable read to call it.
 An example of each (from the 200ng EM-seq sample aligned to GRCh38 using
 bwa-meth) is provided in Figures

\change_inserted -1421919639 1628270179
Due to the reduced DNA damage and resulting longer possible read lengths
 that occur in EM-seq as opposed to WGBS (whole genome bisulfite sequencing),
 we compared two sets of sequencing runs, each with the same 3 sample masses,
 to see if there is a difference between the two aligners with regard to
 the number of miscalls, as it is possible longer reads could allow for
 more low-mappability Cs to be called using reads extending into higher-mappabil
ity regions.
 We found that EM-seq may have a marginally higher percentage of miscalled
 Cs at some input masses, but the effect is not very large (see Figure

For miscalls in ClinVar genes, there is no real difference (discounting
 the two outliers, which will be discussed shortly) between the percent
 of miscalls with EM-seq as opposed to WGBS.
 However, there are two WGBS samples that are significant outliers across
 many of the analyses we performed: the 200ng WGBS sample aligned to GRCh38
 with bwa-meth, and the 50ng WGBS sample aligned to GRCh38 with Bismark
 (see Figures

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in the same manner.
 We observed that compared to bwa-meth, Bismark produced more high MapQ
 reads in repetitive regions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bad-mapq"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In addition, Bismark and bwa-meth use different systems to define values
 for MapQ.
 Bismark (as a result of using Bowtie2 for alignment) reports MapQ based
 on number of reference mismatches, producing values between 0 and 42 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "noauthor_qc_nodate,johnurbangenome_biofinysics_2014"

\end_inset

.
 Bwa-meth (using BWA-MEM for alignments) follows the SAM specification in
 estimating probabilities in the MapQ field.

\change_inserted -1421919639 1628276852
 Overall, we observed a somewhat higher percent of miscalls with Bismark
 than we did with bwa-meth, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 genes.

\begin_layout Standard

We also examined the effect of using the T2T reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nurk_complete_2021"

\end_inset

 in place of GRCh38, since the T2T reference is much more complete than
 GRCh38, including repetitive regions such as centromeres, telomeres, and
 rDNA, which could play a role in where methylation is called and what areas
 of the genome have unique enough sequence to support calling.
 We found that, as we predicted, there were far fewer miscalls in the T2T
 data as compared to the GRCh38 data, with less than half the number of
 miscalls in T2T as in GRCh38, with total calls being roughly in the same
 range between the two reference sequences (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:t2t"
plural "false"

 This indicates that it is indeed true that using the T2T reference can
 allow for better calling of methylation (as shown by the reduced percentage
 of miscalls).

 MethylDackel uses a default value of 10 as a minimum MapQ which should
 include mostly single locus reads, however inaccurate MapQs can lead to
 reads being incorrectly included in methylation calling.
 In order to eliminate reads in low-mappability regions, a patch was created
 for MethylDackel which allows it to take as an input a bigWig file which
 is then used to filter out read pairs (this patch currently only supports
 paired-end reads) where neither mate intersects a high-mappability region.
 The patch allows for user configuration of the low mappability threshold
 and the number of bases which must be equal to or above that threshold
 in order for the read pair to be kept (the defaults are a low mappability
 threshold of 0.01 and to require 15 bases that are greater than or equal
 to that threshold in a single read).
 The filtering algorithm has been optimized both by loading the mappability
 data into memory before calling, and through the use of a custom run-length
 compressed binary file format that we here term BBM (Binary BisMap).
 This format can store the mappability data for the hg38/GRCh38 human genome
 in 143 MB, compared to 1.11 GB when stored as a bigWig, giving a compression
 ratio for this dataset of 7.78:1.
