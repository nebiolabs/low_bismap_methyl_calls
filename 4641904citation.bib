Moreover, using subcellular fractionation of transiently transfected COS-7 cells, both MAL and BENE were identified in detergent-resistant membranes. These results suggest the existence of a novel family of MAL-related proteins (including MAL, BENE, and plasmolipin) with primary structure homologies and with the distinctive features of having unusual biochemical properties such as lipid-like behaviour and/or the ability to reside in glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains.},

DNA Research, 4, 53-59, 1997), the occurrence of chimeric clones and the content of clones with coding potentiality were analyzed using the randomly sampled clones with insert sizes of 5 to 7 kb. When the chromosomal location of 30 clones was determined by the radiation-hybrid mapping method, the map positions assigned from the 3'- and 5'-end sequences separately were coincident for 29 clones, suggesting that the occurrence of chimeric clones is at most 1/30. Using 91 clones mapped to chromosome 1, the content of clones that have the potentiality coding for proteins larger than 100 amino acid residues was estimated to be approximately 50\% (46 out of 91 clones) on the basis of nucleotide sequence analysis and coding potentiality assay in vitro. No significant open reading frames were detected in the remaining clones. Although the clones coding for short peptides may not have been included in the above estimation, the libraries constructed from the whole brain mRNA fraction appear to contain a considerable amount of clones corresponding to the 5'-truncated transcripts in an unprocessed form and/or those with long 3'-untranslated regions.},

Inflammation, PI3K-AKT, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis were identified as the main pathways that are dysregulated in these dementias. All of these dementias are regulated by 12 shared transcription factors. Protein-chemical interaction network analysis of dementia switch genes revealed that valproic acid may be neuroprotective for these dementias. Collectively, we identified shared and unique dysregulated gene expression, pathways and regulatory factors among dementias. New key mechanisms that lead to the development of dementia were revealed and it is expected that these data will advance personalized medicine for patients.},

We find that interaction-disruptive SNVs are prevalent at both rare and common allele frequencies. Furthermore, these results suggest that 10.5\% of missense variants carried per individual are disruptive, a higher proportion than previously reported; this indicates that each individual's genetic makeup may be significantly more complex than expected. Finally, we demonstrate that candidate disease-associated mutations can be identified through shared interaction perturbations between variants of interest and known disease mutations.},

In this study, we have generated a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) around DISC1. This has been achieved by utilising iterative yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screens, combined with detailed pathway and functional analysis. This so-called 'DISC1 interactome' contains many novel PPIs and provides a molecular framework to explore the function of DISC1. The network implicates DISC1 in processes of cytoskeletal stability and organisation, intracellular transport and cell-cycle/division. In particular, DISC1 looks to have a PPI profile consistent with that of an essential synaptic protein, which fits well with the underlying molecular pathology observed at the synaptic level and the cognitive deficits seen behaviourally in schizophrenics. Utilising a similar approach with dysbindin (DTNBP1), a second schizophrenia risk gene, we show that dysbindin and DISC1 share common PPIs suggesting they may affect common biological processes and that the function of schizophrenia risk genes may converge.},

Patients with germline mutations in DICER1, a ribonuclease involved in microRNA processing, have increased risk of pineoblastoma, but genetic drivers of sporadic pineoblastoma remain unknown. Here, we analyzed pediatric and adult pineoblastoma samples (n = 23) using a combination of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing. Pediatric and adult pineoblastomas showed distinct methylation profiles, the latter clustering with lower-grade pineal tumors and normal pineal gland. Recurrent variants were found in genes involved in PKA- and NF-κB signaling, as well as in chromatin remodeling genes. We identified recurrent homozygous deletions of DROSHA, acting upstream of DICER1 in microRNA processing, and a novel microduplication involving chromosomal region 1q21 containing PDE4DIP (myomegalin), comprising the ancient DUF1220 protein domain. Expresion of PDE4DIP and DUF1220 proteins was present exclusively in pineoblastoma with PDE4DIP gain.},

PARTICIPANTS: Patients with clinical diagnosis of NPHP and genetic diagnosis of total deletion of NPHP1 (n = 5) were included in this study.
METHODS: Patients with clinical diagnosis of NPHP (n = 57) were screened for total deletion of NPHP1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the 20 exons of NPHP1. The clinical and ophthalmological findings of NPHP type 1 patients were reviewed. Additionally, four exons of MALL, a gene adjacent to NPHP1, were amplified using PCR, and amplification failure was considered a homozygous deletion encompassing the corresponding exons.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Ophthalmological findings in NPHP type 1 patients.
RESULTS: Five of 57 patients with clinical diagnosis of NPHP were diagnosed as having NPHP type 1 by genetic analysis. Chronic renal failure was diagnosed in these five patients at 7.9-15.4 years of age. All the patients with NPHP type 1 had progressive decline in visual acuity with various ages of onset (2-17 years). Ophthalmological examinations revealed unexpected findings of retinopathy with large or small flecks, which was compatible with Stargardt-like retinopathy or albipunctatus retinopathy in majority of them (four of five). The genetic study revealed an additional deletion of exon 1 of the adjacent gene MALL.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the unexpectedly common retinal involvement of NPHP type 1 with an additional MALL deletion in a Korean cohort.},

        abstract = {The human Usher syndrome (USH) is the most frequent cause of combined hereditary deaf-blindness. USH is genetically heterogeneous with at least 11 chromosomal loci assigned to 3 clinical types, USH1-3. We have previously demonstrated that all USH1 and 2 proteins in the eye and the inner ear are organized into protein networks by scaffold proteins. This has contributed essentially to our current understanding of the function of USH proteins and explains why defects in proteins of different families cause very similar phenotypes. We have previously shown that the USH1G protein SANS (scaffold protein containing ankyrin repeats and SAM domain) contributes to the periciliary protein network in retinal photoreceptor cells. This study aimed to further elucidate the role of SANS by identifying novel interaction partners. In yeast two-hybrid screens of retinal cDNA libraries we identified 30 novel putative interacting proteins binding to the central domain of SANS (CENT). We confirmed the direct binding of the phosphodiesterase 4D interacting protein (PDE4DIP), a Golgi associated protein synonymously named myomegalin, to the CENT domain of SANS by independent assays. Correlative immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses showed a co-localization of SANS and myomegalin in mammalian photoreceptor cells in close association with microtubules. Based on the present results we propose a role of the SANS-myomegalin complex in microtubule-dependent inner segment cargo transport towards the ciliary base of photoreceptor cells.},

        abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of years of life lost. Genetic factors contribute to stroke prevalence, and candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants associated with ischemic stroke risk. These variants often have small effects without obvious biological significance. Exome sequencing may discover predicted protein-altering variants with a potentially large effect on ischemic stroke risk.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of rare and common genetic variants to ischemic stroke risk by targeting the protein-coding regions of the human genome.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) analyzed approximately 6000 participants from numerous cohorts of European and African ancestry. For discovery, 365 cases of ischemic stroke (small-vessel and large-vessel subtypes) and 809 European ancestry controls were sequenced; for replication, 47 affected sibpairs concordant for stroke subtype and an African American case-control series were sequenced, with 1672 cases and 4509 European ancestry controls genotyped. The ESP's exome sequencing and genotyping started on January 1, 2010, and continued through June 30, 2012. Analyses were conducted on the full data set between July 12, 2012, and July 13, 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Discovery of new variants or genes contributing to ischemic stroke risk and subtype (primary analysis) and determination of support for protein-coding variants contributing to risk in previously published candidate genes (secondary analysis).
RESULTS: We identified 2 novel genes associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke: a protein-coding variant in PDE4DIP (rs1778155; odds ratio, 2.15; P = 2.63 × 10(-8)) with an intracellular signal transduction mechanism and in ACOT4 (rs35724886; odds ratio, 2.04; P = 1.24 × 10(-7)) with a fatty acid metabolism; confirmation of PDE4DIP was observed in affected sibpair families with large-vessel stroke subtype and in African Americans. Replication of protein-coding variants in candidate genes was observed for 2 previously reported GWAS associations: ZFHX3 (cardioembolic stroke) and ABCA1 (large-vessel stroke).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exome sequencing discovered 2 novel genes and mechanisms, PDE4DIP and ACOT4, associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke. In addition, ZFHX3 and ABCA1 were discovered to have protein-coding variants associated with ischemic stroke. These results suggest that genetic variation in novel pathways contributes to ischemic stroke risk and serves as a target for prediction, prevention, and therapy.},
