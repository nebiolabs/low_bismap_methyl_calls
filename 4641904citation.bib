	Abstract = {The GENCODE Consortium aims to identify all gene features in the human genome using a combination of computational analysis, manual annotation, and experimental validation. Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci. GENCODE 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers.},

@article{Garrett-Bakelman2015,
	Abstract = {DNA methylation pattern mapping is heavily studied in normal and diseased tissues. A variety of methods have been established to interrogate the cytosine methylation patterns in cells. Reduced representation of whole genome bisulfite sequencing was developed to detect quantitative base pair resolution cytosine methylation patterns at GC-rich genomic loci. This is accomplished by combining the use of a restriction enzyme followed by bisulfite conversion. Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS) increases the biologically relevant genomic loci covered and has been used to profile cytosine methylation in DNA from human, mouse and other organisms. ERRBS initiates with restriction enzyme digestion of DNA to generate low molecular weight fragments for use in library preparation. These fragments are subjected to standard library construction for next generation sequencing. Bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines prior to the final amplification step allows for quantitative base resolution of cytosine methylation levels in covered genomic loci. The protocol can be completed within four days. Despite low complexity in the first three bases sequenced, ERRBS libraries yield high quality data when using a designated sequencing control lane. Mapping and bioinformatics analysis is then performed and yields data that can be easily integrated with a variety of genome-wide platforms. ERRBS can utilize small input material quantities making it feasible to process human clinical samples and applicable in a range of research applications. The video produced demonstrates critical steps of the ERRBS protocol.},

@article{Chen2017,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications of DNA, such as 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine, play important roles in development and disease. Here, we present a cost-effective and versatile methodology for the analysis of DNA methylation in targeted genomic regions, which comprises multiplexed, PCR-based preparation of bisulfite DNA libraries followed by customized MiSeq sequencing. RESULTS: Using bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite conversion of DNA, we have performed multiplexed targeted sequencing to analyse several kilobases of genomic DNA in up to 478 samples, and achieved high coverage data of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine at single-base resolution. Our results demonstrate the ability of this methodology to detect all levels of cytosine modifications at greater than 100{\texttimes} coverage in large sample sets at low cost compared to other targeted methods. CONCLUSIONS: This approach can be applied to multiple settings, from candidate gene to clinical studies, and is especially useful for validation of differentially methylated or hydroxymethylated regions following whole-genome analyses.

@article{breiling_epigenetic_2015,
	Abstract = {The chemical modification of DNA bases plays a key role in epigenetic gene regulation. While much attention has been focused on the classical epigenetic mark, 5-methylcytosine, the field garnered increased interest through the recent discovery of additional modifications. In this review, we focus on the epigenetic regulatory roles of DNA modifications in animals. We present the symmetric modification of 5-methylcytosine on CpG dinucleotide as a key feature, because it permits the inheritance of methylation patterns through DNA replication. However, the distribution patterns of cytosine methylation are not conserved in animals and independent molecular functions will likely be identified. Furthermore, the discovery of enzymes that catalyse the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine not only identified an active demethylation pathway, but also a candidate for a new epigenetic mark associated with activated transcription. Most recently, N6-methyladenine was described as an additional eukaryotic DNA modification with epigenetic regulatory potential. Interestingly, this modification is also present in genomes that lack canonical cytosine methylation patterns, suggesting independent functions. This newfound diversity of DNA modifications and their potential for combinatorial interactions indicates that the epigenetic DNA code is substantially more complex than previously thought.},
